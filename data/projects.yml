    Interlopers was started in 2004 out of my frustration at the lack of a decent community and resource to contribute to. It has grown to become one of the leading level design communities for Half-Life 2 and other Source powered games.

    I have been responsible for front-end development, content writing, community management and other general tasks. The site is written in PHP and is heavily integrated into [phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com/).
