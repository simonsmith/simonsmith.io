    Responsible for building an internal, responsive [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) single page application. Built to allow users in Japan manage Universal's music catalogue.

    As well as building and maintaining the features of the application I also implemented the [Karma test runner](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/index.html) to allow automated unit testing of JS code.

    The look and feel was primarily handled by Bootstrap 3. Grunt was used for various automated tasks (JS uglifying, Sass compilation etc) with Bower as the package manager for third party libraries.

    Git was the VCS and I adopted a branching and rebasing workflow to add new features.
