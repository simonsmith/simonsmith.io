Led the rebuild of three separate applications into React and a more modern
stack of technologies. Included:
  - Components with CSS modules and TypeScript
  - Testing with Jest and Cypress
  - Node APIs for fetching data from upstream services and transforming for the client

Provided technical leadership on larger features to product, marketing and
development teams. This included B2C applications on the Treatwell marketplace as well
as B2B Sass products used by partners in various types of venues.

Worked alongside native iOS/Android teams to coordinate the implementation of
React Native into the Treatwell app.

Led a team of five front end developers of varying seniority to ensure
products are delivered efficiently, including creating backlogs, code reviews
and mentoring. Worked closely with Engineering Managers to collate feedback for
team members and ensure their career goals are aligned.

Worked in a more platform focused role of front end development, assisting other
engineers with leading the development of business critical features. This
allowed focus on providing tooling, library/framework updates and various other
tasks that support engineers day to day.

Keen proponent of accessibility at Treatwell and ensured the applications were a
pleasant experience for less able users, including those relying on
screenreaders and keyboard use.

Worked on an internal open source repository of reusable components, hooks and
other modules that implement Treatwell's atomic design system. Includes atoms
for Text, Button, Input as well as Molecules like Dropdown, Modal etc.
Provided low level layout components for layout like Stack and Inline. All of
this can be themed with CSS custom properties to allow different teams to adopt
them.
