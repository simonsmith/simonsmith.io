Led the rebuild of three separate applications from an older jQuery + Backbone
architecture to React + Redux:
  - Components using CSS modules and TypeScript
  - Tested with Jest and Cypress
  - Node APIs responsible for fetching data from upstream services and
    transforming for the client

Organised a team of front end developers to ensure the products are delivered
efficiently, including creating backlogs, code reviews and mentoring. Worked
closely with Engineering Managers to collate feedback for team members and
ensure their career goals are aligned.

Working with native iOS/Android teams to implement parts of the Treatwell app
with React Native.

Provided support on larger features to product, marketing and other business
areas and empowered other engineers to be able to lead the requirement gathering
and development. This allowed me to focus on a role geared towards front end
platform which mainly revolved around library updates, creating tooling to
make other engineers more efficient and other general non-user facing tasks.

Proponent of accessibility at Treatwell and ensured the applications were a
pleasant experience for less able users, including those relying on
screenreaders and keyboard use.

Worked on an internal open source repository of reusable components, hooks and
other modules that implement Treatwell's atomic design system. Includes atoms
for Text, Button, Input as well as Molecules like Dropdown, Modal etc.
Provided low level layout components for layout like Stack and Inline. All of
this can be themed with CSS custom properties to allow different teams to adopt
them.

Hosted knowledge sharing sessions for the different front end teams at
Treatwell on various topics relating to advanced React practices, testing and
state management.
